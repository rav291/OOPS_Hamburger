Hi there,
I've created a simple java program which let's you order the Hamburger of your choice. Here, you have 3 hamburger types. Toppings for the Deluxe as well as the regular burger are different from those of the healthy hamburger. Also, the toppings are fixed for the selected type of burger. I'm yet to write the program for customised toppings for the burger.
Any suggestions are most welcome.
